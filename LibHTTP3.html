<h2>UnrealEngine2 support</h2>
Version 2 has been developed using the UT2004 build of the UnrealEngine2. However, there's a big chance that this library also works on other UnrealEngine2 build without much additional work. <br />
If you are going to use this library on a diffirent build of the UnrealEngine2, please notify me (elmuerte <i>at</i> drunksnipers.com) so we can create a release version of that build.

<h2>Documentation</h2>
The documentation for this library can be created from the source using <a href="http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/UnCodeX" target="_blank">UnCodeX</a> but it is also available on the <a href="http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/LibHTTP" target="_blank">UnrealWiki</a>.

<h2>Version history</h2>
New in version 200:
<ul>
	<li> Supports HTTP 1.1</li>
	<li> Cached resolves</li>
	<li> Redirection history</li>
	<li> Chuncked encoding automatically decoded</li>
	<li> Added connection timeout</li>
	<li> More delegates</li>
</ul>

New in version 300:
<ul>
	<li> bug fixes</li>
	<li> Improved easy of use:
		get(), post(), head()</li>
	<li> Support for <code>multipart/form-data</code> POST data</li>
	<li> Two different transfer modes: Normal and Fast (tries to download as much
		data as allowed within a single tick)</li>
	<li> Support for proxy authentication, you get the best performance by
		setting the right user/pass in the beginning. Otherwise the code using
		this library will have to do additional processing when the proxy
		user and pass are not accepted.</li>
	<li> Better support for various authentication methods</li>
	<li> Support for digest authentication (more secure HTTP authentication). When
		digest is used instead of basic the client has to make 2 requests. With
		the first request the server will send information needed to construct
		the response. Basic authentication doesn't have this issue.</li>
	<li> Cookie storage class will automatically be created when
		<code>bProcCookies</code> or <code>bSendCookies</code> is set to true
		(and the cookies hasn't been set)</li>
</ul>

New in version 350:
<ul>
	<li>All delegates contains a HttpSock Sender argument</li>
	<li>New function string randString(optional int length, optional coerce string prefix)</li>
	<li>MultiPart divider string is now more unique (prevents potential issues with the content data)</li>
	<li>Empty multipart items are never added</li>
	<li>Made more support functions public</li>
	<li>New utility function string timestampToString(int timestamp, optional string Timezone, optional string format) that will convert a UNIX timestamp to a string (RFC 1123, RFC 1036, RFC 2822, ANSI C asctime formats supported)</li>
	<li>Fixed potentional issues with timestamps and cookies</li>
</ul>

New in version 400:
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the location parsing where the port was never parsed correctly.</li>
	<li>Added a workaround for the quoted strings in structs bug in UE2 for the cookies, in some cases cookie values could have a quote or two.</li>
	<li>... change to use xURL</li>
	<li>... added bAuthRetry thing</li>
	<li>...</li>

    New in version 400:                                                         <br />
    * redone the redirection processing, now with better support for each
        redirection type.                                                       <br />
    * new variable bRfcCompliantRedirect, set this to false for the old, and
        bad, redirection handling on 301/302 headers (e.g. transform POST into
        GET)                                                                    <br />
    * moved DNS caching to a global object, multiple HttpSock classes now use
        the same cache data                                                     <br />
    * added automatic retrying when authentication data is provided in the url,
        the prefered method for using authenticated locations is to provide the
        username and password in the url or set them in the currenturl after the
        OnRequireAuthorization was received.                                    <br />
    * ClearRequestData() will now automatically clear authentication information

</ul>
