<h2>UnrealEngine2 support</h2>
Version 2 has been developed using the UT2004 build of the UnrealEngine2. However, there's a big chance that this library also works on other UnrealEngine2 build without much additional work. <br />
If you are going to use this library on a diffirent build of the UnrealEngine2, please notify me (elmuerte <i>at</i> drunksnipers.com) so we can create a release version of that build.

<h2>Documentation</h2>
